Hi all! I just wanted to announce even more changes to the Blog.

## Updates
* Added more meta data information to help with embedding article links, etc.
* Styled the input buttons (e.g. the search button).
* Author information for comments is now inserted below the avatar.
* Fixed comments breaking CSS when shrinking browser.
* Set a max width of 100% for each image to prevent them from going outside of their divider/card.
* Implemented strike-through text and video support for Markdown (now I can make articles utilizing that).

This was a good update in my opinion.

Another big thing I want to add is auto-saving for signed in users (i.e. just me right now). This way I can write articles without worrying about information getting erased from an event such as a power outage. I already have a plan for this and will be implementing.
