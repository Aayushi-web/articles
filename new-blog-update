I've released a new blog update that I've been working on all of tonight!

## Fixes
* The "By: <name>" text is now aligned to the left along with the creation date.
* When the share link copy button is clicked, a notification is displayed in the bottom-right corner.
* The tagging system has been improved by creating separate models for them.
* If an image doesn't have a banner, there is now a fallback banner.

## Additions
* Category tags which have a green-ish background.
* Twitter and Facebook share buttons on each article.
* Introducing Comments.
* Simple profiles for users (front-end not done).

* Friendly URLs that'll improve search engine results and readability.

## Back-End Changes
* Added code for adding/modifying/ and deleting articles and comments.
* Each text area that supports Markdown now has a column to the right that automatically converts the user's current input that is using Markdown to HTML. 

## Other
* Search Engine optimization applied via meta tags/Google.
* Searching now includes title, description, and contents into search instead of just tags.

## Things To Add/Improve On
* Masonry seems to be breaking at times and not automatically fitting rows/columns correctly.
* Improve comment style and find out why default PNG avatar is showing up as non-transparent.
* Add support for strike-through text and YouTube videos via Markdown syntax.

## Conclusion
I am really happy I was able to implement these features and additions. It really helped me learn a lot about Django and it was also generally fun. My only problem was I stayed up until morning to get this done.

Anyways, still a lot to do, but I'm really happy with the progress :)

Ah, oh yeah, I have to add support for emojis like `:)`
